# 🧩 Shopify Codex Builder — Core Repository

This repository is built specifically for **OpenAI Codex** to create, improve, and iterate Shopify sections.

It acts as Codex’s *memory and workspace* for the entire Shopify project —  
so every new section generated here becomes a reference for future ones.  
The goal is simple: **each iteration should make the next one better.**

## 🏗️ Structure Overview

### `/sections`
This folder contains **one file per Shopify section**.  
Each file (e.g. `test.liquid`) includes the complete code for a section —  
HTML/Liquid, CSS, and JavaScript — ready to paste into **Shopify → Edit Code**.

**Purpose:**
- Every section here is a *fully working building block* for the site.  
- Codex learns your preferred structure, schema format, and naming patterns.  
- When you prompt “create a new section,” Codex should reuse and evolve this format.

💡 *Think of this folder as Codex’s training history — the more sections you add, the smarter its next section becomes.*

### `/effects`
This folder is your **effect library** — a free-flowing list of visual and motion patterns you like to use.

- `effectlist.txt` (or `.md`) lists each effect with:
  - **Name** – what the effect is called  
  - **Usage** – where/how it should be applied  
  - **Code** – example JavaScript snippet  
  - **CSS** – styling logic  

**Purpose:**
- Acts as Codex’s internal *toolbox* for motion and transitions.  
- When Codex is building a new section, it should look here first  
  instead of inventing a new animation from scratch.  
- Ensures visual and behavioral consistency across all future sections.

💡 *Example: When you say “add a wave pulse animation,” Codex can reference `/effects/effectlist` to pull your preferred version.*

## 🧠 Codex Context & Goal

This repo is the **foundation for a Shopify storefront** built entirely through Codex.  
Each new section generated here is:
- Written by Codex → stored here → improved next time.
- Structured for Shopify (`sections/`, Liquid schema, etc.).
- Designed for iteration, learning, and compounding quality.

Codex should:
1. Treat this repo as its *knowledge base*.
2. Use `/sections` to learn how your Shopify sections are organized.
3. Use `/effects` as its creative library for animations.
4. Always output ready-to-paste Shopify section code — no external bundlers or frameworks.

---

## 🔁 Workflow Summary

1. Open Codex → select this repo as environment.  
2. Prompt Codex to **create or improve a section** (e.g. “Add a credibility label to the intro of the quiz”).  
3. Codex reads existing files, references effectlist, and generates a new or improved section file.  
4. Copy the result into Shopify’s “Edit Code” or test locally.  
5. Commit the updated file back here — so Codex can learn from it next time.

---

## 🎯 Purpose Recap

- Build and refine Shopify sections faster and smarter.  
- Let Codex learn your style and preferred motion system.  
- Turn this repo into a **growing brain** for your Shopify storefront.
